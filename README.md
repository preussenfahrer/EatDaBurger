 ## Description:
    
EatDaBurger is an application where a user can input various types of burgers (or burger-style foods) into a search bar. Once they've done this, they can then click "Eat thy burger!" and it will display in a colulmn called "to be devoured." If the food is making the user hungry, they should click the "Devour" button, which will move the burger into the "devoured" column. EatDaBurger saves the user input in a mySQL database. The user must also use npm packages to run the server, and install mySQL. EatDaBurger is styled with handlebars, so that has to be installed also. EatDaBurger is a fun way to see what sort of burgers you want to devour, in addition to setting up a server and keeping results in a mySQL database.

    
 ## Installation      
    
 To use EatDaBurger, make sure you install the necessary npm packages. These include: express (for your server), handlebars (for the styling of the page), and mysql (for connecting to the database).

    
 ## Information
    
 EatDaBurger is easy to use and, while it is far from pretty, it does function on the backend.
